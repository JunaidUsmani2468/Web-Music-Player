# Spotify UI Clone 🎵

This project is a high-fidelity, static clone of the Spotify desktop application's user interface. It was built from scratch using only **HTML5** and **CSS3** to practice and showcase front-end web development skills.

This project was completed as part of a learning module under the guidance of **Shradha Khapra (Apna College)**.

## ✨ Features

This is a static UI-only project, but it successfully replicates the visual components of the Spotify app, including:

- **Left Navigation Sidebar:** A sidebar with links for Home, Search, and Your Library, as well as playlist creation.
- **Main Content Area:** A dynamic-looking grid layout showcasing "Trending" and "Featured" charts.
- **Bottom Music Player:** A persistent player bar at the bottom, which includes:
  - Song information (artist and title).
  - Standard player controls (play, pause, next, previous).
  - A seek bar and time display.
  - Volume and other utility controls.

## 💻 Tech Stack

- **HTML5:** Used for the semantic structure and markup of the application.
- **CSS3:** Used for all styling, including:
  - **CSS Flexbox** for creating complex, responsive layouts.
  - Custom properties (variables) for managing the color palette and spacing.
  - Font Awesome for icons.
